Installation can be done manually or through the install script.

***WARNING!*** THE INSTALL SCRIPT WILL ERASE ANY CONFIGURATIONS YOU ALREADY HAVE. MAKE BACKUPS IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM.

*Disclaimer:* This was designed for Fedora. The install script *will not* work on any distro not very close to fedora, and the dotfiles I cannot give any guarantees on.

### Automatic install
* Download the install script
* Execute it in your terminal

### Manual install
* Clone the repository
* Move the dotfiles into ~/.config
* (If a directory below isn't present, create it.)
* Move any wallpapers into ~/Pictures/Hyprpapers
* Move the cursor to ~/.icons
* Move the fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts

#### If you have any issues, idk.
