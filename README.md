Installation can be done manually or through the install script.
*WARNING!* The install script will erase any configurations you already have. Make backups.
*Disclaimer:* This was designed for Fedora. The install script *will not* work on any distro not very close to fedora, and the dotfiles I cannot give any guarantees on.
Automatic install:
* Download the install script
* Execute it in your terminal

Manual install:
* Clone the repository
* Move the dotfiles into ~/.config
* (If a directory below isn't present, create it.)
* Move any wallpapers into ~/Pictures/Hyprpapers
* Move the cursor to ~/.icons
* Move the fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts
